# Portfolio Website
  
The main componets of the site are up and running. While there is an issue with sending emails, once I fix the issue, it should all be set to go. Keep an eye on the issues if you're planning to clone the repository  

## Development Tools
  
Tools that aided the development in the this project include React.js, JavaScript, SendGrid, HTML/CSS, BootStrap, Express.js, and a few other technologies 
  
## Deployment
  
The site is live at [ellisalcantara.com](www.ellisalcantara.com)!  
  
## Documentation
  
While there is some code documentation, I'm looking to further increase the documentation so people can reuse this as a template and further understand whats going on.  
  
## Extra
  
For now, I'm leaving my own assets and text but I will come back again to strip the code so one can use this as a template.  

For any issues that you see arise, feel free to create an issue so I can take a look at it.  
If it's urgent, please feel free to email me at ellisalcantara@gmail.com
